# Privacy Policy

Effective as of <time datetime='2023-07-24'>24 July 2023</time>.

**European users**:  If you are located in the European Economic Area (the “**EEA**”) or the United Kingdom (the “**UK**”), please read the <a title="Privacy notice to European users" href="#notice-to-european-users">**Notice to European Users**</a> below in addition to this Privacy Policy for information about your personal information and your privacy rights.

This Privacy Policy describes how PartyKit, Inc. and our subsidiaries and other affiliates (“**PartyKit**,” “**we**”, “**us**” or “**our**”) processes personal information that we collect through our digital or online properties or services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “**Service**”). PartyKit may provide additional or supplemental privacy policies to individuals for specific products or services that we offer at the time we collect personal information.

PartyKit provides an open source platform designed for building real-time collaborative applications.

Our websites, products and services are designed for enterprise customers and their representatives. We do not offer products or services for use by individuals for their personal, family or household purposes. Accordingly, we treat all personal information we collect as pertaining to individuals in their capacities as representatives of the relevant enterprise and not their individual capacities.

### Personal information we collect

Information you provide to us. Personal information you may provide to us through the Service or otherwise includes:

Third-party sources. We may combine personal information we receive from you with personal information we obtain from other sources, such as:

- Public sources, such as government agencies, public records, social media platforms, and other publicly available sources.
- Marketing partners, such as joint marketing partners and event co-sponsors.
- Third-party services, such as social media services, that you use to log into, or otherwise link to, your Service account. This data may include your username, profile picture and other information associated with your account on that third-party service that is made available to us based on your account settings on that service.

### How we use your personal information

**Service delivery and operations.** We may use your personal information to:

**Research and development.** We may use your personal information for research and development purposes, including to analyze and improve the Service and our business and to develop new products and services. As part of these activities, we may create aggregated, de-identified and/or anonymized data from personal information we collect. We make personal information into de-identified or anonymized data by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We may use this aggregated, de-identified or otherwise anonymized data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze and improve the Service and promote our business.

**Direct marketing.** We and our service providers may send you PartyKit-related or other direct marketing communications as permitted by law, including by email. You may opt-out of our marketing communications as described in the Opt-out of marketing section below.

**Service improvement and analytics.** We may use your personal information to analyze your usage of the Service, improve the Service, improve the rest of our business, help us understand user activity on the Service, including which pages are most and least visited and how visitors move around the Service, as well as user interactions with our emails, and to develop new products and services.

**Compliance and protection.** We may use your personal information to:

With your consent. In some cases, we may specifically ask for your consent to collect, use or share your personal information, such as when required by law.

### How we share your personal information

**Opt-out of communications.** You may opt-out of marketing-related emails by following the opt-out or unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the email, or by contacting us. Please note that if you choose to opt-out of marketing-related emails, you may continue to receive service-related and other non-marketing emails.

**Blocking images/clear gifs:** Most browsers and devices allow you to configure your device to prevent images from loading. To do this, follow the instructions in your particular browser or device settings.

**Do Not Track.** Some Internet browsers may be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to “Do Not Track”. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.

**Declining to provide information.** We need to collect personal information to provide certain services. If you do not provide the information we identify as required or mandatory, we may not be able to provide those services.

**Linked third-party platforms.** If you choose to connect to the Service through your social media account or other third-party platform, you may be able to use your settings in your account with that platform to limit the information we receive from it. If you revoke our ability to access information from a third-party platform, that choice will not apply to information that we have already received from that third party.

### Other sites and services

The Service may contain links to third party websites, mobile applications, and other online services operated by third parties. In addition, our content may be integrated into web pages or other online services that are not associated with us. These links and integrations are not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated with, any third party. We do not control websites, mobile applications or online services operated by third parties, and we are not responsible for their actions, nor are they subject to this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the other websites, mobile applications and online services you use.

#### Security

We employ a number of technical, organizational and physical safeguards designed to protect the personal information we collect. However, security risk is inherent in all internet and information technologies, and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information.

#### International data transfer

We are headquartered in the United States and may use service providers that operate in other countries. Your personal information may be transferred to the United States or other locations where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your state, province, or country.

#### Children 

The Service is not intended for use by anyone under 16 years of age. If you are a parent or guardian of a child from whom you believe we have collected personal information in a manner prohibited by law, please contact us. If we learn that we have collected personal information through the Service from a child without the consent of the child’s parent or guardian as required by law, we will comply with applicable legal requirements to delete the information.

#### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by updating the date of this Privacy Policy and posting it on the Service or other appropriate means. Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting the modified version (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting). In all cases, your use of the Service after the effective date of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acknowledging that the modified Privacy Policy applies to your interactions with the Service and our business.

#### Retention

We retain personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for compliance and protection purposes.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

When we no longer require the personal information, we have collected about you, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. If we anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you), we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

#### Other information

**No obligation to provide personal information.** You do not have to provide personal information to us. However where we *need* to process your personal information either to comply with applicable law or to deliver our Service to you, and you fail to provide that personal information when requested, we may not be able to provide some or all of our Service to you. We will notify you if this is the case at the time.

**No sensitive personal information.** We ask that you not provide us with any sensitive personal information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Service, or otherwise to us. If you provide us with any sensitive personal information to us when you use the Service, you must consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal information, you must not submit such sensitive personal information through our Service.

**No automated decision-making and profiling.** As part of the Services, we do not engage in automated decision-making and/or profiling, which produces legal or similarly significant effects. We will let you know if that changes by updating this Privacy Policy.

**Security**. We have put in place procedures designed to deal with breaches of personal information. In the event of such breaches, we have procedures in place to work with applicable regulators. In addition, in certain circumstances (including where we are legally required to do so), we may notify you of breaches affecting your personal information.

<u>Your rights</u>

**General.** European data protection laws give you certain additional rights regarding your personal information. If you are located in Europe, you may ask us to take any of the following actions in relation to your personal information that we hold:

- **Access.** Provide you with information about our processing of your personal information and give you access to your personal information.
- **Correct.** Update or correct inaccuracies in your personal information.
- **Delete.** Delete your personal information where there is no lawful reason for us continuing to store or process it, where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons that will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
- **Portability**. Port a machine-readable copy of your personal information to you or a third party of your choice, in certain circumstances. Note that this right only applies to automated information for which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
- **Restrict**. Restrict the processing of your personal information, if, (i) you want us to establish the personal information’s accuracy; (ii) where our use of the personal information is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (iii) where you need us to hold the personal information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our use of your personal information but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use.
- **Object.** Object to our processing of your personal information where we are relying on legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedom – you also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
- **Withdraw Consent**. When we use your personal information based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.

**Exercising These Rights.** To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact details provided above. We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Whether or not we are required to fulfill any request you make will depend on a number of factors (e.g., why and how we are processing your personal information), if we reject any request you may make (whether in whole or in part) we will let you know our grounds for doing so at the time, subject to any legal restrictions. Typically, you will not have to pay a fee to exercise your rights; however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within a month of receipt. It may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests; in this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

**Your Right to Lodge a Complaint with your Supervisory Authority**. Although we urge you to contact us first to find a solution for any concern you may have, in addition to your rights outlined above, if you are not satisfied with our response to a request you make, or how we process your personal information, you can make a complaint to the data protection regulator in your habitual place of residence.

Data processing outside Europe

We are a US-based company and many of our service providers, advisers, partners or other recipients of data are also based in the US. This means that, if you use the Services, your personal information will necessarily be accessed and processed in the US. It may also be provided to recipients in other countries outside Europe.

It is important to note that that the US is not the subject of an ‘adequacy decision’ under the GDPR – basically, this means that the US legal regime is not considered by relevant European bodies to provide an adequate level of protection for personal information, which is equivalent to that provided by relevant European laws.

Where we share your personal information with third parties who are based outside Europe, we try to ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it in accordance with applicable privacy laws by making sure one of the following mechanisms is implemented:

- **Transfers to territories with an adequacy decision.** We may transfer your personal information to countries or territories whose laws have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal information by the European Commission or UK Government (as and where applicable) (from time to time).
- **Transfers to territories without an adequacy decision.**
    - We may transfer your personal information to countries or territories whose laws have **not been deemed to provide such an adequate level of protection (e.g., the US, see above).
    - However, in these cases:
        - we may use specific appropriate safeguards, which are designed to give personal information effectively the same protection it has in Europe – for example, standard-form contracts approved by relevant authorities for this purpose; or
        - in limited circumstances, we may rely on an exception, or ‘derogation’, which permits us to transfer your personal information to such country despite the absence of an ‘adequacy decision’ or ‘appropriate safeguards’ – for example, reliance on your explicit consent to that transfer.

You may contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal information out of Europe.

However, please note that if you use your browser settings to block all or some cookies, you may not be able to access all or parts of our Site.

### 5. Your consent

Strictly necessary cookies do not require your consent. For analytics cookies, we request your consent before placing them on your device. You can give your consent by clicking on the appropriate button on the cookie banner displayed to you.

### 6. Can I withdraw my consent?

If you do not wish to give consent or wish to withdraw your consent to any performance or targeting and functionality cookies at any time, you will need to delete, and block or disable cookies via your browser settings; see below for more information on how to do this. Please note that disabling these cookies will affect the functionality of the Site and may prevent you from being able to access certain features on the Site.

#### 7. What type of cookies do we use and why?

We use “analytics” and “strictly necessary” cookies:

#### 7.1 Strictly Necessary cookies:

These cookies are necessary for the Site to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the Site will not work as they should.

#### 7.2 Analytics cookies:

These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our Site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the Site and gather information on error messages. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our Site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.

### 8. Retention

A cookie or similar technology will exist for different periods of time depending on the purpose of the cookie. For example, a session cookie which enables the Site to operate will only exist on your device whilst you browse our Site, but other cookies will remain on your device for longer such as some functionality cookies which need to stay on your device so that the Site can recognise you when you return. For more information about how long a cookie remains on your device, please see the cookie table below.

### 9. Other technologies

In addition to cookies, our Sites may use other technologies, such as Flash technology to pixel tags to collect information automatically.

*Browser Web Storage*

We may use browser web storage (including via HTML5), also known as locally stored objects (“LSOs”), for similar purposes as cookies. Browser web storage enables the storage of a larger amount of data than cookies. Your web browser may provide functionality to clear your browser web storage.

*Web Beacons*

We may also use web beacons (which are also known as pixel tags and clear GIFs) on our Sites and in our HTML formatted emails to track the actions of users on our Sites and interactions with our emails. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages or within HTML formatted emails. Pixel tags are used to demonstrate that a webpage was accessed or that certain content was viewed, typically to measure the success of our marketing campaigns or engagement with our emails and to compile statistics about usage of the Sites, so that we can manage our content more effectively.

### 10. Keeping our cookie notice up to date

We may need to update our cookie notice from time to time if we decide to use cookies differently. Any changes will be updated here.

For more information about how we process personal information collected from cookies please refer to our website [privacy policy](https://partykit.io/privacy).

If you have any questions or would like more information about the ways we use cookies please contact us at [contact@partykit.io](mailto:contact@partykit.io).
