### Add PartyKit to an existing app

Add PartyKit to your existing project using the following command in the project's root directory:

```bash
npx partykit@latest init
```

This command installed two packages (<a href="/reference/partyserver-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>partykit</code></a> and <a href="/reference/partykit-cli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>partysocket</code></a>) and added the `party` directory with a server template.

## Run a dev server

Run the following command in your terminal in your project's directory to start the dev server:

```bash
npx partykit dev
```

## Develop your server

Add desired behavior to your server, and connect it to the UI.

```bash
npx partykit deploy
```
