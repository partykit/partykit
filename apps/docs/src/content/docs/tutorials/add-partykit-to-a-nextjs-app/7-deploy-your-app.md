PartyKit hosts the real-time server but you can host your website at any deployment platform of your choosing.

While you don't need separate repositories for the client and the PartyKit server, you will need to deploy them separately.

## Deploy PartyKit server

Next, deploy your PartyKit server:

```bash
npm partykit deploy
```

When the deployment completes, you will have your PartyKit URL (which will follow the pattern of `[your project's name].[your GitHub username].partykit.dev`). You will need this URL when deploying your Next.js app.

To read more about deploying PartyKit apps, check <a href="/guides/deploying-your-partykit-server/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our guide</a>.

## Deploy Next.js app

In the case of this specific Next.js app, you will most probably deploy it to Vercel, in which case you can follow <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/deploying-nextjs-app/deploy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Vercel deployment guide</a>.

Please remember to also set the environment variables mentioned (such as `NEXT_PUBLIC_PARTYKIT_HOST` with the URL generated when deploying the PartyKit server in the previous step). To do so, you can follow <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Vercel guide on secrets management</a>.

In the example repository, we've included an `.env.example` file that contains the environment variables you need to set.
