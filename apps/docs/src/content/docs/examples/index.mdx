## Mosaic - realtime collaborative game

![mosaic game](../../../assets/mosaic.png)

This is a multiplayer drawing challenge web toy from [Matt Webb](https://twitter.com/genmon).

Each turn, a user is asked whether a random tile should be black or white according to a given challenge. All users see the same mosaic, and all users play at the same time. It's fun to see how quickly the image converges... or doesn't.

ðŸŽˆ **Explore:** [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/partykit/sketch-mosaic) | [live demo](https://mosaic-party.vercel.app/)

## Two-way hyperlinks and social webpages

![hyperlinks](../../../assets/hyperlinks.png)

Three web components from [Matt Webb](https://twitter.com/genmon): the first one badges all internal links on a site with how many people are present at the other end. Another tells you if a hyperlink has been used, in realtime, while you're using the page. A third adds multiplayer cursors to any webpage, as if the cursors are sitting behind the content, through frosted glass.
