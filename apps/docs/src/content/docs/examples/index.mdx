## Realtime Reaction Counters

![reactions](../../../assets/reactions.gif)

See your friends react in real time. As soon as someone reacts to your content, the counter is updated on all connected clients. You can **create a new room with its own counter** by appending any room name to the URL. This means that you can easily implement separate counters for any subpage or section (for example, for any blog post or video on your website). Every time you use a new identifier, a new room is automatically created - and every room is its own API, which you can access.

This example contains a barebones HTML page and an SSR version built with Next.js. The server was written to accommodate both approaches.

## Cursors with country flags

[Matt Webb's](https://twitter.com/genmon) 'Voronoi' app features cursors with country flags on a colorful, ever-changing background. Cursors indicate presence and movement on the demo, which helps your users get a sense that they are together in one room.

## Connection Counter

This example shows how many people are currently viewing any of the pages linked from the the current one - the counter placed near the links increases or decreases as users move around the app. It is a demo of an advanced use of [multi-party communication](https://docs.partykit.io/guides/using-multiple-parties-per-project/).

![mosaic game](../../../assets/mosaic.png)

This is a multiplayer drawing challenge web toy from [Matt Webb](https://twitter.com/genmon).

Each turn, a user is asked whether a random tile should be black or white according to a given challenge. All users see the same mosaic, and all users play at the same time. It's fun to see how quickly the image converges... or doesn't.

![hyperlinks](../../../assets/hyperlinks.png)

Three web components from [Matt Webb](https://twitter.com/genmon): the first one badges all internal links on a site with how many people are present at the other end. Another tells you if a hyperlink has been used, in realtime, while you're using the page. A third adds multiplayer cursors to any webpage, as if the cursors are sitting behind the content, through frosted glass.
