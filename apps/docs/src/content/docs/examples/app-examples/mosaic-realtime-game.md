This is a multiplayer drawing challenge web toy from [Matt Webb](https://twitter.com/genmon).

Each turn, a user is asked whether a random tile should be black or white according to a given challenge. All users see the same mosaic, and all users play at the same time. It's fun to see how quickly the image converges... or doesn't.
