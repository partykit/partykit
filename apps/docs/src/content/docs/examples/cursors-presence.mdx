import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Help your users feel like they are together in one room by adding realtime cursors that indicate their movement on the page.

## Design Pattern

Some description of the design pattern

## Apps using cursors

See how these projects impelmented cursors

<CardGrid>
    <Card title="Cursors with country flags" icon="star">
		Matt Webb's 'Voronoi' app features cursors with country flags on a colorful, ever-changing background.

		To share state, the party rebroadcasts all cursor moves. (The cursor positions are not absolute; they are scaled to the viewport.) All cursors are tracked on the server (party-side) so that new clients can immediately see all cursors. The current cursor state is stashed in the websocket connection object itself.

		Mouse and touch pointers are differentiated. For touchscreen users, their own cursor is also drawn for them, under their finger.

</CardGrid>
