PartyKit simplifies developing real-time and multiplayer applications. To understand how PartyKit does this, let's dive deeper into what PartyKit is, and how it works.

## Overview

PartyKit is a deployment and hosting platform for **globally distributed**, **stateful**, **on-demand**, **programmable** **web servers**. In practice, this means that:

- You **implement** the server code using [the `Party.Server` JS/TS API](/reference/partyserver-api).
- You **deploy** the server to the PartyKit runtime using [the `partykit` CLI](/reference/partykit-cli).
- We **host** the servers on [the PartyKit runtime](#partykit-runtime).

## PartyKit runtime

The PartyKit runtime is a modern standards-based JavaScript environment built on top of the [`workerd`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd) runtime by Cloudflare (which powers [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)).

The runtime is hosted on Cloudflare's global edge network, within ~50 ms reach of about 95% of the world's Internet-connected population.

In addition to running modern JavaScript, it also supports [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), thousands of modules from [the npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [WebAssembly modules](https://webassembly.org/).

## PartyKit servers

Above, we described PartyKit as a hosting platform for **globally distributed**, **stateful**, **on-demand**, **programmable** **web servers**.

That's a lot of words! Let's unpack them, one by one.

### Web server

Each PartyKit server (also known as a **Party**), is backed by a Cloudflare [Durable Object](/glossary/#durable-object).

You can communicate with a Party with standard HTTP requests:

```ts
fetch(`https://${project}.${user}.partykit.dev/parties/main/${id}`, {
  method: "GET",
});
```

More interestingly, you can also connect to a Party using standard WebSockets, enabling real-time push between client and the party instance (also known as "room"):

```ts
new WebSocket(`https://${project}.${user}.partykit.dev/parties/main/${id}`);
```

Because the Party server uses standard HTTP and WebSocket protocols, you can connect to them from anywhere: web browsers, native mobile apps, or embedded devices.

PartyKit also provides optional client SDKs, such as the [PartySocket](/reference/partysocket-api/) JavaScript/TypeScript client.

### Programmable

PartyKit servers are fully programmable in TypeScript, JavaScript, and using any language that can be compiled into WebAssembly modules, such as Rust, Swift or C.

```ts
export default class Server implements PartyServer {
  onRequest(req: PartyRequest) {
    return new Response("Hello via HTTP");
  },
  onConnect(connection: PartyConnection) {
    connection.send("Hello via WebSockets");
  },
  onMessage(message: string) {
    this.party.broadcast(`Received ${message} via WebSockets`);
  }
```

PartyKit allows you to write your own business logic, or use industry-standard open source packages to implement common use cases and workflows - unlike most hosted real-time platforms offer limited or no customisability of the server-side behaviour.

### On-demand

PartyKit can create instances **on-demand**, unlike standard web servers, which you need to provision, scale and maintain yourself.

In above examples, we saw that each party instance has a unique `id`:

```ts
fetch(`https://${project}.${user}.partykit.dev/parties/main/${id}`
```

The `id` can be any arbitrary string, but it will often correspond to an id of the document, project, room, user, or other entity to which you are adding multiplayer or real-time characteristics.

The PartyKit runtime handles request routing based on the `id`, guaranteeing that:

- Every time you connect to a Party using the **same** `id`, the PartyKit platform guarantees that the request is routed to the same room (in other words, to the same Party server instance).

- Every time you connect with a **new** unique `id`, the PartyKit platform creates a new web server instance for you.

Parties are so lightweight that we can spin them up with practically zero start-up time. In this regard, they are similar to a serverless function.

### Stateful

Unlike a serverless function, each room is also **stateful**, which means you can manage state of a Party in the same way you would in any TypeScript or JavaScript class:

```ts
export default class Server implements PartyServer {
  this.messages = [];
  onMessage(message: string) {
    // keep track of messages in-memory
    this.messages.push(message);
    // send them to all connected clients
    this.party.broadcast(JSON.stringify({ messages: [message]} ));
  }
  onConnect(connection: PartyConnection) {
    // when a new client connects, send them the full message history
    connection.send(JSON.stringify({ messages: this.messages }));
  }
```

This is possible, because:

- Each Party (the server) runs in a separate [Durable Object](/glossary/#durable-object), and is fully isolated from any other process.
- PartyKit guarantees that each request or connection with the same `id` is routed to the same room (instance of the Party), and vice versa.

This means you can radically simplify the programming model compared to the standard stateful web servers by treating each Party effectively as a single-tenant application.

### Globally distributed

Each room runs in a separate [Durable Object](/glossary/#durable-object) inside CloudFlare's edge network and we can create servers on-demand in any of hundreds of data centers around the world. Because of that, they are reliable and horizontally scalable.

This is also why PartyKit servers are suitable for real-time, latency-sensitive use cases. The connection between the client and server is typically very fast as we always create the server in the network-topologically nearest data center.
