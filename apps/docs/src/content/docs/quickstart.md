description: Bring realtime collaboration to your app with PartyKit.

Follow this quickstart guide to create and deploy your first PartyKit app in just a few minutes.

Note that to run PartyKit, you need to have Node v. 17 or higher installed.

## Create a PartyKit app

To start your adventure, run the following command in your terminal to create a new PartyKit project:

```bash
npm create partykit@latest
```

:::tip[Create projects faster]
To create a PartyKit project faster, you can pass arguments to the `create` command, such as `--yes` to skip all prompt by accepting defaults, `--typescript` to default to TypeScript, `--git` to initialize git repository, or `--install` to  install dependencies.
:::

That's it! Navigate to your project's directory, and explore your first PartyKit app ðŸ¥³

### Add PartyKit to an existing app

Alternatively, you can add PartyKit to your existing project using the following command in the project's root directory:

```bash
npx partykit@latest init
```

## Run a dev server

To see PartyKit in action, run the following command in your terminal in your project's directory:

```bash
npx partykit dev
```

Once the server is running, open localhost with the designated port (defaulting to 1999) in two windows to simulate two users logging using the app.

## Deploy your app

To deploy your app, run the following command in your terminal in your project's directory:

```bash
npx partykit deploy
```

If you're running PartyKit for the first time, you will be prompted to log in using GitHub. A new browser window will open with a device activation page where you can paste the code that was automatically copied to your clipboard from the terminal output.

Next, you will be asked to grant permissions to PartyKit. Once you do that, your app will be deployed to your `partykit.dev` domain, which will follow the pattern of `[your project's name].[your GitHub username].partykit.dev`.

After the domain has been provisioned (up to two minutes), **share the link with your friends and play with it live** ðŸ¥³

:::note
Custom domains will be available in the near future.
