Last week Kent C. Dodds launched his magnum opus, a fullstack web development course called *Epic Web*. The course is massive in scale - it comprises 452 videos divided into 56 sections, with additional snacks like 25 interviews with experts. It was an instant success and was very warmly welcomed by the web dev community.

We couldn't be prouder to be a part of this amazing feat. Right before the launch, Kent and Sunil added the presence feature and it just worked.
