description: We’ve built a multiplayer drum machine demo with Tone.js and Yjs. It’s a ton of fun. Here’s how it works.

Hey come on over to **[partycore](https://partycore.labs.partykit.dev/rooms/1999)** and play with our drum sequencer.

There are three tracks. You tap a step to turn it on or off. Drag the slides at either end of a track to change the loop length — you can get some good polyrhythms going.

Ignore my sounds in that demo. I can’t put together a good beat.

But some people are really good at this. It’s a multiplayer sequencer, so my main trick is to hang out on that webpage and wait for someone else to come along and make a better beat…

### The code is open so you can see how it works

Here’s the GitHub repo: [sketch-sequencer](https://github.com/partykit/sketch-sequencer).

The app is built and served with PartyKit using the [Remix template](https://github.com/partykit/remix-starter). I like building that way because I can serve up a whole site from `partykit.dev`.

Data sync between the app and the server is achieved with Yjs using [y-partykit](https://docs.partykit.io/reference/y-partykit-api/), PartyKit’s native Yjs backend. So there’s nothing bespoke in the server ([see sequencer.ts](https://github.com/partykit/sketch-sequencer/blob/main/party/sequencer.ts) for the code)…

…whereas on the client side there’s a bunch. Because while it’s neat to host a shared Yjs doc so easily, I find it fiddly to interact with the doc directly. So I write high level functionality and provide it in a hook. [Look at useSequencer](https://github.com/partykit/sketch-sequencer/blob/main/app/hooks/use-sequencer.tsx) to see how to edit the steps and the loop ranges. This is a pattern I reach for pretty frequently.

Finally, how are the samples scheduled? That’s all client-side. While the steps and ranges are synced across browsers, the playhead itself isn’t synced. Each browser uses the Web Audio framework [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io) to play the tracks independently.

### new website, who dis?

You may have noticed the smart new look of our [homepage](https://www.partykit.io) and this here blog.

We’ve been working with Mark Hurrell of [ThinkM Studio](https://thinkm.studio). The new design shipped last week.

So when Mark showed me this design of his polyrhythmic drum sequencer, we had to make it. I wired up the multiplayer backend Thursday evening and built out the rest on Friday.

Now we all get to play. Thanks Mark!
