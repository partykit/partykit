In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, the fusion of multiplayer platforms with artificial intelligence (AI) is not just a trend; it's the future of collaboration. That's why we're thrilled to unveil PartyKit AI, a selection of LLMS and a vector database directly into the PartyKit environment, powered by Cloudflare's incredible worldwide edge network.

## AI without the hassle

PartyKit AI is designed to make accessing and utilizing AI models as straightforward as possible. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a curious innovator, running an AI model in PartyKit is now as simple as: `await ai.run('@model', optioms)`.

## Diverse Range of AI Models at Your Fingertips

We understand the diverse needs of our users, which is why PartyKit AI offers an array of models to choose from:

- **Text Generation**: Unleash your creativity with Llama2 and Mistral.
- **Text to Image Transformation**: Bring your visions to life with Stability Diffusion XL.
- **Speech to Text Conversion**: Capture every word accurately with Whisper.
- **Text and Image Classification**: Categorize and analyze data effortlessly.
- And more to come!

## Empower Your Search with Embeddings and Vector Databases

PartyKit AI goes beyond mere model access. We've integrated support for embeddings and vector databases, paving the way for advanced capabilities like semantic search and Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG). To give you a taste of what's possible, we provide code examples for creating, storing, and querying embeddings using our vector database, Vectorize.

## Why PartyKit AI?

At the heart of PartyKit is our commitment to real-time collaboration. The integration of AI is a natural progression of this commitment. When Cloudflare announced Vectorize and Workers AI, we instantly recognized the potential of treating AI as a functional call within our platform. PartyKit AI is our first step towards realizing this vision.

## Flexibility and Extensibility

While we provide first-class support for the above features, PartyKit AI is also built for flexibility. Users can connect to third-party vector databases or use alternative Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond Llama2 and Mistral. In fact, an emerging pattern among our early adopters is the use of hosted machine learning models as a preliminary step before calling out to more advanced AI solutions like OpenAI's GPT-4 for user-facing completions. Our goal is to make these AI models easily accessible and integratable with PartyKit's diverse functionality, offering them as managed services within our ecosystem. Further, the combination of long lived multiplayer rooms and AI models opens up a world of possibilities for building AI agents, and true collaborative experiences between humans and AI.

## Getting Started with PartyKit AI

To jumpstart your journey with PartyKit AI, we've prepared comprehensive documentation and a variety of examples, including:

## Building a Search Engine with PartyKit AI

The true power of PartyKit AI lies in the integration of its various components. By combining embeddings with Vectorize, you can create a fully-hosted, AI-driven search engine within the PartyKit framework. For detailed guidance, refer to our dedicated blog post. [TODO]

## What Will You Create?

PartyKit AI is still in its experimental phase, and we expect it to evolve. However, it's already primed for building incredible real-time AI applications. We're eager to see the innovative ways you'll leverage PartyKit AI in your projects.
