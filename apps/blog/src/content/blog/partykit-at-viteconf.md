Last week PartyKit made an appearance at [ViteConf](https://viteconf.org/23), an online conference that celebrates the Vite community, and the web dev community at large.

ViteConf is known for its nurturing community vibe ✨ Even though the talks are pre-recorded, the conference Discord is booming with love, jokes, and serious questions. To further extend this experience, the StackBlitz team wanted to experiment with adding a little interactivity to the conference platform. It is yet another way to enhance the feeling of togetherness at an online event.

A week before the conference, Matias Capeletto, Vite core maintainer, added the real-time feature himself, using our [*Realtime Reaction Counter*](https://github.com/partykit/example-reactions) example as reference. In his words:

<a href="https://twitter.com/patak_dev/status/1708849034201268561" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img style="width:650px; height: auto;" src="/content-images/partykit-at-viteconf/patak-partykit.png" alt='Pataks tweet: "I finally got an opportunity to try PartyKit. It works like a charm. A true pleasure to use 💜 Youll play with it this week at the ViteConf party 🍿"'></a>

In this way, the attendees were able to show their love and reward the speakers 💕 Some talks gathered over 2k reactions and the most popular one, [Evan You's Vite keynote](https://viteconf.org/23/replay/vite_keynote) was *hearted* 4,7k times! In total, ViteConf participants shared their joy in real time <nobr>🎈 **23,311 times** 🎈.</nobr>

## Real-time audience experience

Behind the scenes, each talk was connected to its own PartyKit server (called "a room"). This is what the ViteConf rooms activity looked like:

Each spike indicates the beginning of a new talk (when a new PartyKit room was created). In this way, reactions for each talk were kept separately. Important to mention, switching the rooms was imperceivable on the UI.

This experience could further be extended by adding animation, making the reaction heart float on the screen (or in the player), or giving the participants a way to draw something together as the talks progress.

🎈 **I'd love to help you bring real-time interactivity to your event!

## ViteConf replay party 🍿

If you've missed the event, don't worry, you can still watch the talks on [their platform](https://viteconf.org/23/replay). And there are a lot of gems there.

My personal favorite was Sarah Rainsberger's talk on [contributing to docs](https://viteconf.org/23/replay/docs) which featured a lot of birds 🐦

Otherwise, everyone will find something for themselves as the all-star lineup included [Matias Capeletto](https://viteconf.org/23/replay/vite_philosophy), [the StackBlitz team](https://viteconf.org/23/replay/stackblitz_keynote), [Daniel Roe](https://viteconf.org/23/replay/nuxt), [Fred K. Schott](https://viteconf.org/23/replay/astro), [Kent C. Dodds](https://viteconf.org/23/replay/vite_react_router), [Ryan Carniato](https://viteconf.org/23/replay/solid), and many others.

Also, the preparations for ViteConf 2024 have already started. See you there next year!
