Last week PartyKit made a large-event debut at [ViteConf](https://viteconf.org/23), an online conference that celebrates the Vite community, and the web dev community at large.

An all-star lineup included talks from [Evan You](https://viteconf.org/23/replay/vite_keynote), [Matias Capeletto](https://viteconf.org/23/replay/vite_philosophy), [StackBlitz team](https://viteconf.org/23/replay/stackblitz_keynote), [Daniel Roe](https://viteconf.org/23/replay/nuxt), [Fred K. Schott](https://viteconf.org/23/replay/astro), [Kent C. Dodds](https://viteconf.org/23/replay/vite_react_router), and many others.

ViteConf is known for its nurturing community vibe. even though the talks are pre-recorded, the conference Discord is booming with love, jokes, and serious questions.

To further extend this experience, the StackBlitz team decided to experiment with sprinkling a little interactivity onto the conference platform.

Using , ViteConf organizers gave the attendees an opportunity to show their love towards the speakers ðŸ’•
