## Table of contents

## Features & Changes

### Type-safe Frontmatters and Redefined Blog Schema

Frontmatter of AstroPaper 2.0 markdown contents are now type-safe thanks to Astroâ€™s Content Collections. Blog schema is defined inside the `src/content/_schemas.ts` file.

### New Home for Blog contents

All the blog posts were moved from `src/contents` to `src/content/blog` directory.

### New Fetch API

Contents are now fetched with `getCollection` function. No relative path to the content needs to be specified anymore.

```ts
// old content fetching method
- const postImportResult = import.meta.glob<MarkdownInstance<Frontmatter>>(
  "../contents/**/**/*.md",);

// new content fetching method
+ const postImportResult = await getCollection("blog");
```

### Modified Search Logic for better Search Result

In the older version of AstroPaper, when someone search some article, the search criteria keys that will be searched are `title`, `description` and `headings` (heading means all the headings h1 ~ h6 of the blog post). In AstroPaper v2, only `title` and `description` will be searched as the user types.

### Renamed Frontmatter Properties

The following frontmatter properties are renamed.

| Old Names | New Names   |
| --------- | ----------- |
| datetime  | pubDatetime |
| slug      | postSlug    |

### Default Tag for blog post

If a blog post doesn't have any tag (in other words, frontmatter property `tags` is not specified), the default tag `others` will be used for that blog post. But you can set the default tag in the `/src/content/_schemas.ts` file.

```ts
// src/contents/_schemas.ts
export const blogSchema = z.object({
  // ---
  // replace "others" with whatever you want
  tags: z.array(z.string()).default(["others"]),
  ogImage: z.string().optional(),
  description: z.string(),
});
```

### New Predefined Dark Color Scheme

AstroPaper v2 has a new dark color scheme (high contrast & low contrast) which is based on Astro's dark logo. Check out [this link](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/posts/predefined-color-schemes#astro-dark) for more info.
