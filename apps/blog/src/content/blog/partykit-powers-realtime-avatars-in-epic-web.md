description: Kent C. Dodds used PartyKit for users' presence on his course platform.

---

Last week Kent C. Dodds launched his magnum opus, a fullstack web development course called [*Epic Web*](https://www.epicweb.dev/). The course is massive in scale - it consists of 452 videos divided into 56 sections, with additional snacks like 25 interviews with experts. It was an instant success and has been celebrated enthusiastically by the web dev community.

This is only the beginning :)'"></a>

We couldn't be prouder to be a part of this amazing feat. Right before the launch we worked with Kent and added *presence* to the course platform (see [first PR](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/kcdshop/pull/152) and [second PR](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/kcdshop/pull/153)). Presence is a way to create a sense of shared online experience among your users for example by showing their cursors (like in Figma), the place in text they are (like in Google Docs), or by featuring your users' avatars, which is what Kent went with.

It makes you feel like you're not learning alone. Learning is better together. Thanks for making this feature so easy to add PartyKit!'"></a>

## Presence in Epic Web

On the left side of the platform screen, users can see their own profile and a number of other users working on the same lesson -- even though the app runs on `localhost`:

When you open the sidebar, you can see all the avatars as well:

Since the launch, the platform has been sending over 100,000 events a day to PartyKit - a testament to how popular the course is.

## Adding avatars to your website

All PartyKit server code that was needed to implement the real-time avatars feature to Kent's course was the following:

```ts
import type * as Party from 'partykit/server'

type UserPayload = {
	id: string
	avatarUrl: string
	name?: string | null | undefined
}

type Message =
	| { type: 'remove-user'; payload: Pick<UserPayload, 'id'> }
	| { type: 'add-user'; payload: UserPayload }
	| { type: 'presence'; payload: { users: Array<UserPayload> } }

export default class Server implements Party.Server {
	options: Party.ServerOptions = { hibernate: true }
	constructor(party: Party.Party) {
		this.party = party
	}

	updateUsers() {
		const presenceMessage = JSON.stringify(this.getPresenceMessage())
		for (const connection of this.party.getConnections<UserPayload>()) {
			connection.send(presenceMessage)
		}
	}

	getPresenceMessage(): Message {
		const users = new Map<string, UserPayload>()
		for (const connection of this.party.getConnections<UserPayload>()) {
			const user = connection.state
			if (user) users.set(user.id, user)
		}
		return {
			type: 'presence',
			payload: { users: Array.from(users.values()) },
		} satisfies Message
	}

	onMessage(message: string, sender: Party.Connection<UserPayload>) {
		const user = JSON.parse(message) as Message
		if (user.type === 'add-user') {
			sender.setState(user.payload)
			this.updateUsers()
		} else if (user.type === 'remove-user') {
			sender.setState(null)
			this.updateUsers()
		}
	}

	onClose() {
		this.updateUsers()
	}
	
	onError() {
		this.updateUsers()
	}
}
```

Kent later improved the UX to also group the users according to their progress.

Moreover, as privacy is an important consideration, he implemented an option to opt out of avatars, taking full advantage of that PartyKit allows you to write your own business logic.

## Reactions to presence

Learning online often feels like a lonely journey so realtime features added to online courses can help students enjoy the ride a little more.

Responses to Kent's tweets were enthusiatic and positive:

<a href="https://x.com/PaoloRicciuti/status/1715677367799079059?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img style="width:650px; height: auto;" src="/content-images/partykit-powers-realtime-avatars-in-epic-web/kent-feedback-1.png" alt="Two tweets. First from Paolo Ricciuti: 'This is also something I was pleasantly surprised with, very good touch'. Second from Afan Khan: 'Learning with others and through their mistakes is the best way to learn.'"></a>

Presence features like avatars, cursors, chat, or visible text highlighting are generally a well-received idea. Websites, apps, courses, and online experiences feel less lonely and isolated if you know that there are others sharing this moment with you.
