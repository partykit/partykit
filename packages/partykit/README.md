[PartyKit](https://partykit.io/) simplifies developing multiplayer applications.

With PartyKit, you can focus on building multiplayer apps or adding real-time experiences to your existing projects with as little as one line of code. Meanwhile, PartyKit will handle operational complexity and real-time infrastructure scaling.

## Documentation

Go to [docs.partykit.io](https://docs.partykit.io) for documentation, guides and examples.

## Quick start

Note: to run PartyKit, you need to have Node v. 17 or higher installed.

You can create a PartyKit project by running:

```sh
npm create partykit@latest
```

This will ask a few questions about your project and create a new directory with a PartyKit application, that includes a server and a client.

Alternatively, you can add PartyKit to your existing project using the following command in the project's root directory:

```sh
npx partykit@latest init
```

From inside the directory, you can then run `npm run dev` to start the development server. When you'reready, you can deploy your application on to the PartyKit cloud with `npm run deploy`.
