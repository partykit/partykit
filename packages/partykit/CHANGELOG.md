### Patch Changes

- [#409](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/pull/409) [`5593735`](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/commit/559373553f0b89c973b75945e6c18f0259bc453e) Thanks [@dev-badace](https://github.com/dev-badace)! - [fix] filePath in windows

  Fixes #328

  In Windows devices, the assetsMap was generating file paths with double backslashes, resulting in incorrect file paths. This PR addresses this issue by replacing the double backslashes with single forward slashes, ensuring that the file paths are correct and functional.

  some references to `fetch` weren't being imported from undici. global fetch was introduced only in node 18. so the partykit cli (specifically `init`) and create-partykit weren't working on node 16. This fixes that issue (tho we should phase out node 16 support soon)

  clipboardy comes with fallback binaries to use (esp. in windows). If we bundle it into the partykit bundle, then the references to those binaries fail. So we mark it as an external so it installs separately and resolves the binaries correctly.

  This brings back packaging of dependencies for partykit (and introduces it for create-partykit). We had previously disabled it for deps because of esm/cjs nonsense, but we've now figured out how to make them play decently together.

  I had to fork ink-testing-library because of https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink-testing-library/pull/23, I'll remove it once that PR is merged.

  This also updates ink to 4.4.1, which fixes our previous issue where it was exiting early.

  This changes the naming of our exported types from `partykit/server`. The motivation here was aesthetic/simplification. Most of the exports los the `Party` prefix; i.e. `PartyServer` becomes `Server`, `PartyConnection` becomes `Connection`, and so on. If you look at the class example, this doesn't drastically change the code; the import becomes a lot shorter (`import type * as Party from 'partykit/server'` gets all the required types) and required types are taken by `Party.*`.

  I also did a run on all the docs/templates and the blog post, but lemme know if I missed anything!

  This fix should pick up the latest versions of partykit /partysocket when installing. We were using the previous beta logic when every package was on the same version. This patch picks up the latest versions of both and uses it.

  (also sneaking in a quick types fix for usePartySocket)

  We hadn't wired up onBeforeConnect/onBeforeRequest for multi parties. To fix this, I did a refactor where _every_ request goes through a common codepath now. Additionally, this also means that `/parties/main/:id` is equivalent to `party/:id`. I also massaged out some differences between the platform/cli facade.

  The common usecase is to add partykit to an existing project, usually running on another stack/provider. This adds an `init` command that simply adds dependencies, a `partykit.json` file, and an entry point. If it's not run inside an existing project, it defers to running `npm create partykit` instead.

  PartyKit now supports a new ES6 Class-based API.

  ## TL;DR;

  Before:

  ```ts
  import type {
    PartyKitServer,
    PartyKitRoom,
    PartyKitConnection,
  } from "partykit/server";

  export default {
    onBeforeConnect(request: Request) {
      request.headers.set("X-User", getUser(request.headers.Authorization));
      return request;
    },
    onConnect(connection: PartyKitConnection, room: PartyKitRoom) {
      room.broadcast(`Someone joined room ${room.id}!`);
    },
  } satisfies PartyKitServer;
  ```

  After:

  ```ts
  import type {
    Party,
    PartyConnection,
    PartyRequest,
    PartyServer,
    PartyWorker,
  } from "partykit/server";

  export default class MyParty implements PartyServer {
    constructor(public party: Party) {}

    static onBeforeConnect(request: PartyRequest) {
      request.headers.set("X-User", getUser(request.headers.Authorization));
      return request;
    }

    onConnect(connection: PartyConnection) {
      this.party.broadcast(`Someone joined room ${this.party.id}!`);
    }
  }

  MyParty satisfies PartyWorker;
  ```

  The old API remains supported for the time being, but we highly recommend starting all new projects with the new API, as the old API may be deprecated in the future.

  ## New Class-based API

  Previously, you created PartyKit servers by exporting an plain object that defines handlers for different events that occur in a room. This was nice and terse, but we found a lot of room for improvement:

  - This API didn't accurately convey PartyKit's mental model of each party being a stateful object (backed by a CloudFlare Durable Object)
  - It was hard to manage derived state safely
  - It was hard to distinguish between code that runs in the Edge worker near the user (e.g.`onBeforeConnect`) and the Party worker that runs where the room was first created (e.g. `onConnect`).
  - The naming of different concepts (parties, rooms, etc) was ambiguous

  With this feedback in mind, we've redesigned PartyKit's primary server interface with a new ES6 Class-based API.

  The following code sample demonstrates the new API, with comments describing what's changing:

  ```ts
  import type {
    Party,
    PartyConnection,
    PartyRequest,
    PartyServer,
    PartyWorker,
    PartyServerOptions,
    PartyConnectionContext,
  } from "partykit/server";

  // PartyKit servers now implement PartyServer interface
  export default class Main implements PartyServer {
    // onBefore* handlers that run in the worker nearest the user are now
    // explicitly marked static, because they have no access to Party state
    static async onBeforeRequest(request: PartyRequest) {}
    static async onBeforeConnect(request: PartyRequest) {}

    // onFetch is now stable. No more unstable_onFetch
    static async onFetch(req: PartyRequest) {}

    // Opting into hibernation is now an explicit option
    readonly options: PartyServerOptions = {
      hibernate: true,
    };

    // Servers can now keep state in class instance variables
    messages: string[] = [];

    // PartyServer receives the Party (previous PartyKitRoom) as a constructor argument
    // instead of receiving the `room` argument in each method.
    readonly party: Party;
    constructor(party: Party) {
      this.party = party;
    }

    // There's now a new lifecycle method `onStart` which fires before first connection
    // or request to the room. You can use this to load data from storage and perform other
    // asynchronous initialization. The Party will wait until `onStart` completes before
    // processing any connections or requests.
    async onStart() {
      this.messages =
        (await this.party.storage.get<string[]>("messages")) ?? [];
    }

    // You can now tag connections, and retrieve tagged connections using Party.getConnections()
    getConnectionTags(
      connection: PartyConnection,
      ctx: PartyConnectionContext
    ) {
      return [ctx.request.cf?.country as string];
    }

    // onConnect, onRequest, onAlarm no longer receive the room argument.
    async onRequest(req: PartyRequest) {}
    async onAlarm() {}
    async onConnect(connection: PartyConnection, ctx: PartyConnectionContext) {
      // You can now read the room state from `this.party` instead.
      this.party.broadcast(JSON.stringify({ messages: this.messages }));

      const country = ctx.request.cf?.country as string;

      // room.connections is now called room.getConnections(tag?)
      // that receives an optional tag argument to filter connections
      for (const compatriot of this.party.getConnections(country)) {
        compatriot.send(
          JSON.stringify({
            message: `${connection.id} is also from ${country}!`,
          })
        );
      }
    }

    // Previously onMessage, onError, onClose were only called for hibernating parties.
    // They're now available for all parties, so you no longer need to manually
    // manage event handlers in onConnect!
    async onError(ws: PartyConnection, err: Error) {}
    async onClose(ws: PartyConnection) {}
    async onMessage(message: string, connection: PartyConnection) {}
  }

  // Optional: Typecheck the static methods with a `satisfies` statement.
  Main satisfies PartyWorker;
  ```

  In addition to moving from an object syntax to class syntax, we've introduced multiple improvements to developer ergonomics:

  ## `onStart` handler

  PartyKit servers are convenient, because they're stateful, but you still need to make sure to store the state into room storage for when the room restarts due to inactivity or exceeding its maximum CPU time.

  There's now a new lifecycle method `onStart` which fires before first connection or request to the room. You can use this to load data from storage and perform other asynchronous initialization, such as retrieving data or configuration from other services or databases.

  ```ts
    // Servers can now keep state in class instance variables
    messages: string[] = [];
    async onStart() {
      this.messages = (await this.party.storage.get<string[]>("messages")) ?? [];
    }
  ```

  The Party will wait until `onStart` completes before processing any connections or requests to the party.

  ## Better support for Hibernatable WebSockets

  In order to support scaling parties to tens of thousands of concurrent connections, PartyKit supports CloudFlare Durable Object [Hibernatable WebSockets API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/hibernatable-websockets-api).

  When opting into hibernation, the server goes to sleep between messages, and only comes alive when there is work to be performed, making it more cost-effective and easier to scale. Hibernation comes with tradeoffs: for certain type of applications, you may want to keep the server in memory for longer between requests.

  ### Explicit hibernation opt-in

  Previously, we automatically opted you into "hibernation mode" when you defined an `onMessage` handler in your server. Now, you can define an `options.hibernate` field, which defaults to `false`:

  ```ts
    readonly options: PartyServerOptions = {
      hibernate: true,
    };
  ```

  ### More convenient message handling

  Previously the so-called "hibernation-mode handlers" `onMessage`, `onError`, `onClose` were only called when you opted into hibernation. They're now available for all servers, so you no longer need to manually manage event handlers in `onConnect`:

  ```ts
    async onMessage(message: string, connection: PartyConnection) {}
    async onError(ws: PartyConnection, err: Error) {}
    async onClose(ws: PartyConnection) {}
  ```

  No more manually registering event handlers in `onConnect`! (Unless you want to, of course.)

  ### Better connection management

  Previously, PartyKit managed connections in memory in a big Map, available in `room.connections`. This meant that every time your server woke up from hibernation, PartyKit needed to rehydrate all connections, which was both slow and expensive.

  Now, instead, you can access connections on `Party` as follows:

  ```ts
  // get connection by id (previously room.connections.get(id))
  const connection = this.party.getConnection(id);
  // iterate over all connection (previously room.connections.values())
  for (const c of this.party.getConnections()) {
  }
  ```

  ### Tagged connections

  You can set additional metadata on connections by returning them from a `getConnectionTags` callback on `PartyServer`:

  ```ts
    getConnectionTags(connection: PartyConnection) {
      return ["some tag"];
    }
  ```

  You can then filter connections by tag, removing the need to wake up hibernated sockets unnecessarily:

  ```ts
  for (const c of this.party.getConnections("some tag")) {
  }
  ```

  ## Naming changes

  While designing the new API, we also wanted to be thoughtful about naming.

  The biggest problem we wanted to solve was the distinction between "parties" and "rooms", which was confusing for many. From now on, we'll refer to PartyKit server instances as "parties", and will no longer use the "room" terminology.

  To reflect this, we made the following names in our TypeScript types:

  - `PartyKitRoom` is now `Party`, and refers to a single server instance (i.e. Durable Object)
  - `PartyServer` refers to the instance code definition of the server (i.e. Durable Object)
  - `PartyWorker` refers to the static code definition of the server which runs in a separate worker before connecting to the Party.
  - `PartyKit*`-prefixed types are now shortened to `Party*` by dropping the "Kit". It's cleaner.
  - `room.parties` ➡️ `party.context.parties` — Represents the taxonomy and relationship between parties more clearly.

  The old names are deprecated, but will continue to work. The deprecated names are decorated with JSDoc `@deprecated` pragmas, so you can find the types you need to rename.

  ## Breaking changes

  There are no breaking runtime changes. Existing PartyKit projects should continue working as expected.

  ### Incoming request types

  However, while making changes to our TypeScript types, we discovered that the type definitions for `on(Before)Request` and `on(Before)Connect` were incorrectly defined to receive a Fetch API `Request` type, whereas at runtime they would always receive a `PartyKitRequest` type, which is an instance of CloudFlare Workers -specific Request object.

  We decided to fix this issue, which means you'll need to make the following change:

  ```diff

  + import { PartyRequest } from "partykit/server";

  export default {
  -  onBeforeRequest(request: Request) {
  +  onBeforeRequest(request: PartyRequest) {
      return new Request(request.url, { headers: { "x-foo": "bar" } });
    }
  }
  ```

  Note that you can still return a normal `Request` -- only the input type has changed.

  This feature allows you to optionally configure onBeforeRequest/onRequest on a room. just like oBC/oC, the former runs in a worker closest to you, and the later runs in the room. This also makes defining onConnect fully optional. This should open the door to some interesting integrations.

  - the filter aren't tested yet

  In `dev` we have some issues with the way we initialise/restart servers

  - if an external process is generating assets, and it does it quickly, then we end up crashing the assets server
  - we were restarting the assets folder watcher whenever the assets watcher restarted
  - we weren't cleaning up the assets folder watcher on effect rerun
  - we weren't cleaning up the custom build folder watcher on effect rerun

  So, the fixes:

  - debounce setting the assets map (100ms, is short enough to not be noticeable, but long enough to let esbuild manager a restart)
  - close the assets build watcher correctly
  - don't restart the assets build watcher incessantly
  - close the custom build watcher correctly

  This changes the behaviour of unstable_onValidate. Instead of return a boolean, this function now expects an error to be thrown if it's an invalid connection. Further, you can now return a json-serialisable object that gets passed on to onConnect (currently inside room.connections.<id>.unstable_initial, but we'll expose it on the connection soon.). This is particularly cool because onBeforeConnect will usually be run on a different machine from onConnect, but you'll still be able to pass data like session info etc on to onConnect.

  misc: remove `serve`, fix builds.

  Currently, `.storage` is only held in memory. This is fine for most usecases, but it means if you shutdown the dev process, we lose any state you may have been holding. This PR adds a config/flag `persist` to store this locally. We also turn it on by default. You can pass `--persist false` in the cli, or `persist: false` in config to turn it off (or `true` for default path). You can also pass `--persist some/custom/path` in the cli, or `persist: "some/custom/path" in the config, to use a custom path for the state.

  This enhances the static assets story, with features and utility:

  - First, we remove `sirv`/`polka`, and use esbuild's server to serve assets in dev, since we already have it.
  - We then introduce a config for actually building static assets. It's a tiny subset of esbuild's configuration; it takes (all fields optional):
    - entry: a path to an entry, or an array of paths, or even no entry at all (and simply serve the assets folder)
    - bundle: whether to bundle dependencies (default true)
    - outdir: where to put the output (default assets dir + '/dist')
    - minify: whether to minify (default false in dev, true for deploy)
    - splitting: whether to split up lazy import (default true)
    - format: one of `esm | cjs | iife` (default esm)
    - sourcemap: default true
    - define: expressions to substitute in the source; it merges the top level `define` here coneveniently, which means you can also pass it as a cli arg (`--define key:value`)
    - loader: corresponding to esbuild's loader args

  Lovely. the config can also be a plain string, which it's use as the entry point instead.

  I updated all the examples to use this new config, it drastically simplifies (imo) the boilerplate to get started.

  This implements persistence / storage for partykit. It hijack's cloudflare's DO storage api (without config options). This doesn't implement DO's i/o gates yet, but that's kinda fine, because it means you have to write code that's good in dev (but production will automatically be better). We'll implement them later. Also this currently does in-memory storage. We'll fix that in the future by (optionally) using disk for persistence.

  We'd previously vendored the libs used by y-partykit (yjs, lib0, etc) to workaround a bug in edge-runtime https://github.com/vercel/edge-runtime/issues/243, but it makes using other libs that include those libs difficult. So instead this patch removes the vendoring, and applies the other workaround (which is to set `minify:true`). The tradeoff for this workaround is that any "dev mode" code (i.e. code wrapped with `if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production')`) will be removed. This is temporary and we'll remove it once the bug is fixed by edge-runtime.

  - This adds support for serving static assets (in dev only). This makes onboarding a little simpler; starting a new project doesn't require (too much) extra tooling. It's fairly simple, you make a field called `assets` in `partykit.json`, or pass it via cli with `--assets <path>`. In the future we _may_ also deploy these assets to partykit directly, we'll see.
  - This also adds support for custom build commands. You may be using some other compile-to-js language, or need to run some codegen, or even compile your client side app; you can now define a command that runs. It looks like this (all fields are optional):

  ```js
  build: {
    command: "...", // the command to run
    cwd: "...", // the directory to run it "in",
    watch: "..." // the directory to "watch" for changes
  }

  This introduces cloudflare's new hibernation api for durable objects. (see https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/durable-objects/#hahahugoshortcode-s2-hbhb)
  It kicks in when you specify `onMessage(){}` in the export. This should let us scale to thousands of connections on a single object, while also not charging for idle objects. Very nice.

  This adds a couple of APIs based on common usage patterns:

  - `room.broadcast(message, without)` lets you broadcast a message to all connections to a room, optionally excluding an array of connection IDs
  - the "socket" now includes `.id`

  This shouldn't break any code, so I'm comfortable landing it.

  When you respond from `onBeforeRequest` or `onRequest`, you have to construct a new response using the `new Response()`.

  Unless you've overridden the global `Response` type to refer to `"@cloudflare/workers-types"`, the type is assumed a [Fetch API Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response). This is a pain in the ass, especially if you have your PartyKit server code as part of your frontend project.

  Because the actual return value will be an instance of whatever Response class is defined in the environment, the type does not matter to us, so let's just allow the user to return either type.

  Not all architectures can be represented with a single 'type' of entity. The interesting ones have multiple types of entities, interconnected by business logic. For example, you could model a chat system with a chatroom entity, a user entity, and a rate limiter entity.

  This patch introduces "multiparty" support. You can define multiple modules with the same `PartyKitServer` interface in different modules, and configure them in `partykit.json`, like so:

  ```json
  main: "./src/main.ts" // your "main" entity, usually performing supervisory work
  parties: {
    chatroom: "chatroom.ts",

    limiter: "rate-limiter.ts"
  }
  // ...
  ```

  You can then reference these entities via `room.parties.<user/chatroom/limiter>.get('some-id')` and then make an http request to it with `.fetch(req)` or open a WebSocket to it with `.connect()`.

  This needs more examples and documentation (and potentially iterating on the api), but let's land it to experiment with the model a little.

  We were using `unstable_initial` to pass info between `onBeforeConnect` and `onConnect`. But it just felt so alien. Now that onConnect also receives request (via https://github.com/partykit/partykit/pull/166), let's just let onBeforeConnect return a Request or a Response. If a Request, it gets passed on to onConnect. Else, it just returns.

  This is a breaking change, but it's a minor one, and it's worth it to get rid of `unstable_initial`.

  When we create a project, we shouldn't try to create a git repo if we're initialising inside another git repo (like a monorepo). This PR detects whether there's a git folder and skips the git repo creation part.

  Additionally:

  The server we spin up makes our tests flaky. we don't have tests for dev logs anyway right now, so let's disable them.

- [#166](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/pull/166) [`2f3676c`](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/commit/2f3676c37122b6ae82e816fab2821d7a25d674ae) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - feat: add `ctx` to `onConnect`

  ## `onConnect(connection, room, context){}`

  Developers want access to additional metadata available on every connection. For example, to implement a rate limiter, they need access to the IP address of the client. They may want access to the user agent, some cookie values, or any of the special `cf` properties like geo information, etc. Most of this information is available on the request object when the connection is made, but we don't actually expose that to the developer right now. I propose we do that.

  We can expose a third parameter to the `onConnect` method that is the `context` object. For now it'll just be an onject with a single property `request` that is the request object. In the future we can add more properties to this object.

  ```js
  onConnect(connection, room, context) {
    const { request } = context;
    const { headers } = request;
    const ip = headers['x-forwarded-for'];
    // do something with the ip
  }
  ```

  Now, the hibernation api variant doesn't include `onConnect` at all. So, we'll need to add that to the hibernation api. So, I also propose that we let folks add an optional `onConnect` method when defining a party. Calling `connection.addEventListener` with that variant will silently do nothing, but maybe we could override that to throw an error instead. Importantly, folks should be able to call `.serializeAttachment` in the `onConnect` method, and recover that data in the `onMessage` method.

  ```js
  export default {
    onConnect(connection, room, context) {
      const { request } = context;
      const { headers } = request;
      const ip = headers["x-forwarded-for"];
      connection.serializeAttachment({ ip });
      // do something with the ip
    },
    onMessage(message, connection, room) {
      const { ip } = connection.deserializeAttachment();
      // do something with the ip
    },
  };
  ```

  This PR adds the context object to `onConnect`. After we land the hibernation api, we can do the additional work mentioned.

  This patch fixes how we generate types (by actually doing so), configuring exports in package.json, and making sure it points to the right thing. I had to write a script that moves the generated types to the root for... javascript reasons ™ but at least it works now. good enough.

  This adds `unstable_onValidate` to server's default export, alongside onConnect. Users are expected to implement this and return a boolean, that will reject the connection when false.

  we weren't applying overrides to config via the cli (eg --name xyz, when config.name was already defined). This fixes the logic.

  When using hibernation, we should cache initialised connections, or else we end up doing it for every message, which seems wasteful.

  We now allow using `onConnect` with `onMessage`. This lets you get access to the context `{request}`. Warning: You can't use `.addEventListener` when using `onMessage`, but it currently just silently fails. We'll make this an error later.
