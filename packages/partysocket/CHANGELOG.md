## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- [#333](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/pull/333) [`dc324d9`](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/commit/dc324d91d9521682bf8490e1fed51d5371a752df) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: `init` doesn't install the right versions of packages

  This fix should pick up the latest versions of partykit /partysocket when installing. We were using the previous beta logic when every package was on the same version. This patch picks up the latest versions of both and uses it.

  (also sneaking in a quick types fix for usePartySocket)

### Patch Changes

- [#251](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/pull/251) [`049bcac`](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/commit/049bcac42aa49e4bddec975c63b7d7984112e450) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - small tweaks to `init`

  - replace `process.env.PARTYKIT_HOST` with just `PARTYKIT_HOST`
  - add a `tsconfig.json`
  - add partykit to devDependencies in `init`
  - strip protocol from host (partysocket, y-partykit)

- [#208](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/pull/208) [`de4e507`](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/commit/de4e507cc7bcab1bd1f51b5e83b09a32578c70a3) Thanks [@jevakallio](https://github.com/jevakallio)! - Allow connecting directly to a multiparty using a `party` field on partysocket

- [#215](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/pull/215) [`cc88615`](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/commit/cc88615a750744fac151f9a0cfae5a94b0f546e2) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - fix: make PartySocket work inside cloudflare/partykit

  The implementation of `ReconnectingWebSocket` tests whether a WebSocket class is valid by the presence of a static field that's not available on CF's/PK's WebSocket class. It's a bit much anyway, so we just remove the test.

  This uses a weaker implementation to generate conneciton IDs if crypto.randomUUID() isn't available in the browser (re: https://github.com/WICG/uuid/issues/23) Fixes https://github.com/partykit/partykit/issues/53

- [#69](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/pull/69) [`9c3418d`](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/commit/9c3418df3cf7173b49217145fb2c77adda4f4330) Thanks [@mellson](https://github.com/mellson)! - Makes partysocket compatible with both esm and cjs.

- [#183](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/pull/183) [`acca510`](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/commit/acca510babe8c1b4a463f2d85aa11f0450f0b771) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - partysocket: export ReconnectingWebSocket class from root

- [#35](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/pull/35) [`7eb3b36`](https://github.com/partykit/partykit/commit/7eb3b3621027480092a927bec5b6096ba4614027) Thanks [@threepointone](https://github.com/threepointone)! - y-partykit (feat): `onCommand` as a server configuration option

  y-partykit currently assumes all messages on the wire are yjs messages (usually all binary data), but we have usecases where we want to send arbitrary commands to the server and act on them (usually still with the context of a doc). So now y-partykit accepts a handler for all string messages that we're calling 'commands' - `onCommand(string, Y.Doc)`.

  Additionally, partysocket now also exports it's base websocket class as partysocket/ws
