  we were trying got be clever and not make a package.json if there was a parent (that's wasn't a monorepo root). Turns out folks have package.json's all the time. So this just always makes a package.json, and only runs the installer in the root package,json dir f it's a monorepo/has workspaces

  When we create a project, we shouldn't try to create a git repo if we're initialising inside another git repo (like a monorepo). This PR detects whether there's a git folder and skips the git repo creation part.

  Additionally:

  - we switch away from `find-config` to `find-up` everywhere, since it works on both files and directories
  - I also took the opportunity to enable `verbatimModuleSyntax` in our tsconfig, which makes vscode import types correctly when we auto-import
