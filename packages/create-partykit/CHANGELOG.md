  We use node's watch mode when developing partykit itself. On node 20, this just goes into an infinite loop, because it restarts on any writes, even if the file hasn't changed (iiuc). We are compiling facade/source.ts to facade/generated.js, while also watching the facade folder, which was triggering the restarts. I moved the outout to dist/generated.js, which fixes the problem.

  some references to `fetch` weren't being imported from undici. global fetch was introduced only in node 18. so the partykit cli (specifically `init`) and create-partykit weren't working on node 16. This fixes that issue (tho we should phase out node 16 support soon)

  This brings back packaging of dependencies for partykit (and introduces it for create-partykit). We had previously disabled it for deps because of esm/cjs nonsense, but we've now figured out how to make them play decently together.

  I had to fork ink-testing-library because of https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink-testing-library/pull/23, I'll remove it once that PR is merged.

  This also updates ink to 4.4.1, which fixes our previous issue where it was exiting early.

  When we create a project, we shouldn't try to create a git repo if we're initialising inside another git repo (like a monorepo). This PR detects whether there's a git folder and skips the git repo creation part.

  Additionally:

  - we switch away from `find-config` to `find-up` everywhere, since it works on both files and directories
  - I also took the opportunity to enable `verbatimModuleSyntax` in our tsconfig, which makes vscode import types correctly when we auto-import
