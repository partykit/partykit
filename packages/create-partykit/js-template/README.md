## ðŸŽˆ $PROJECT_NAME

Welcome to the party, pal!

This is a [Partykit](https://partykit.io) project, which lets you create real-time collaborative applications with minimal coding effort.

[`server.js`](./src/server.js) is the server-side code, which is responsible for handling WebSocket events and HTTP requests. [`client.jsx`](./src/client.jsx) is the client-side code, which connects to the server and listens for events.

You can start developing by running `npm run dev` and opening [http://localhost:1999](http://localhost:1999) in your browser. When you're ready, you can deploy your application on to the PartyKit cloud with `npm run deploy`.
