  The class definition was eagerly looking for a WebSocket class, breaking in non-standards based environments (like node.js), leading to issues like https://github.com/partykit/partykit/issues/698. This removes the class definition, and uses the chunking function directly when required. I think this should fix the problem.

  This is an experimental fix to batch messages into 1MB chunks.

  This release includes bugfixes and new options to `y-partykit` server persistence layer.

  ### Background

  By default, PartyKit maintains a copy of the Yjs document as long as at least one client is connected to the server. When all clients disconnect, the document state may be lost.

  To persists the Yjs document state between sessions, you can use the built-in PartyKit storage by enabling the `persist` option.

  This release fixes known performance and scaling issues with the existing `persist: true` option, and deprecates it in favour of two separate persistence strategies: **snapshot**, and **history**.

  #### Persisting snapshots (recommended)

  In `snapshot` mode, PartyKit stores the latest document state between sessions.

  ```ts
  onConnect(connection, party, {
    persist: {
      mode: "snapshot",
    },
  });
  ```

  During a session, PartyKit accumulates individual updates and stores them as separate records. When an editing session ends due to last connection disconnecting, PartyKit merges all updates to a single snapshot.

  The `snapshot` mode is optimal for most applications that do not need to support long-lived offline editing sessions.

  #### Persisting update history (advanced)

  In `history` mode, PartyKit stores the full edit history of the document.

  This is useful when multiple clients are expected to be able to change the document while offline, and synchronise their changes later.

  ```ts
  onConnect(connection, party, {
    persist: {
      mode: "history",
    },
  });
  ```

  For long-lived documents, the edit history could grow indefinitely, eventually reaching the practical limits of a single PartyKit server instance. To prevent unbounded growth, PartyKit applies a 10MB maximum limit to the edit history.

  You can customise these limits as follows:

  ```ts
  onConnect(connection, party, {
    persist: {
      mode: "history",
      // Maximum size in bytes.
      // You can set this value to any number below 10MB (10_000_000 bytes).
      maxBytes: 10_000_000,

      // Maximum number of updates.
      // By default, there is no maximum, and history grows until maximum amount of bytes is reached.
      maxUpdates: 10_000,
    },
  });
  ```

  Once either limit is reached, the document is snapshotted, and history tracking is started again.

  #### Deprecating `persist: true`

  In previous versions, PartyKit only had one persistence mode:

  ```ts
  onConnect(connection, party, { persist: true });
  ```

  In this mode, PartyKit would store the full edit history of the Yjs document in the party storage. This worked well for short-lived documents, but would break for long-lived documents, as the document history size would grow until it would reach the practical limits of the runtime environment.

  From this version onwards, `persist: true` will function identically to setting `persist: { mode: "history" }`, including respecting the maximum storage limits.

  This option is still supported for backwards compatibility reasons, but will be removed in a future version of `y-partykit`.

  This is an escape hatch to get access to the `Y.Doc` instance, or initialize it if one doesn't exist yet.

  ```ts
  import type * as Party from "partykit/server";
  import type { YPartyKitOptions } from "y-partykit";
  import { onConnect, unstable_getYDoc } from "y-partykit";

  // options must match when calling unstable_getYDoc and onConnect
  const opts: YPartyKitOptions = { persist: true };

  export default class YjsServer implements Party.Server {
    yjsOptions: YPartyKitOptions = { persist: true };
    constructor(public room: Party.Room) {}

    async onRequest() {
      const doc = await unstable_getYDoc(this.room, opts);
      return new Response(doc.getText("message")?.toJSON());
    }

    onConnect(conn: Party.Connection) {
      return onConnect(conn, this.room, opts);
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Caveats

  This API is marked `unstable`, because it's likely to be superceded by a better API in the future.

  Notably, the `options` argument provided to `unstable_getYDoc` should match the options provided to `onConnect`. We do currently not change the options when each change is made, so the first options passed are applied, and any further changes are ignored. We try to detect changed options, and show a warning if changes are detected.

  So, out persistence layer has a 128kb limit on values, but `y-partykit` should/could be used for documents bigger than that. So we implemented a chunking strategy that break up values across multiple keys. When making keys for these, we didn't pad the generated indexes, which meant that for sufficiently large values, we might have assembled them back in the wrong order (because lexicographical sorting). This is a fix for that. It's a breaking change, but oddly I haven't heard from people who've faced the problem at all.

  It's better to default to `gc: true` with partykit, so memory is better used in partykit servers. We should also ensure `gc` and `persist` are never used together. So this PR adds a little logic to find a better default, and ensuring the 2 never clash.

  We'd previously vendored the libs used by y-partykit (yjs, lib0, etc) to workaround a bug in edge-runtime https://github.com/vercel/edge-runtime/issues/243, but it makes using other libs that include those libs difficult. So instead this patch removes the vendoring, and applies the other workaround (which is to set `minify:true`). The tradeoff for this workaround is that any "dev mode" code (i.e. code wrapped with `if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production')`) will be removed. This is temporary and we'll remove it once the bug is fixed by edge-runtime.

  y-partykit currently assumes all messages on the wire are yjs messages (usually all binary data), but we have usecases where we want to send arbitrary commands to the server and act on them (usually still with the context of a doc). So now y-partykit accepts a handler for all string messages that we're calling 'commands' - `onCommand(string, Y.Doc)`.

  Additionally, partysocket now also exports it's base websocket class as partysocket/ws
